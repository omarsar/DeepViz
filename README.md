## TODO
1. Compare similar accounts based on other features (e.g., age and gender)
2. Combine / Merge charts for better comparison of patient and queried user
3. Hide user details (age, gender and identity) and focus more on user features with respect to mental disorders.

More details coming soon! For questions please email: ellfae@gmail.com
